//The CALLING CONTEXT of this line of code is xwing.
//We get a reference to a function back, then we invoke it,
// because it is followed by parens. with the params in the parentheses.

// WHEN THE FUNCTION IS CALLED, 'this' now points to xwing
// before assignment, pilot is null, after the function call,
// it is set to "Luke Skywalker".
// then the update method is called from within the setPilot function.
// this is bound to xwing, so this#update looks in the xwing object for an the
//update keyword. It finds a function and executes it using the variables in the
// parens (none in this case).
xwing.setPilot("Luke Skywalker");
// >> "This X-Wing has changed!"

console.log(xwing.pilot);
// >> "Luke Skywalker"

//Because xwing is the calling context, javascript looks for setPilot on xwing.
// It finds it, and executes it, because there are parentheses.
